-  **What are the training times for the examples in JoliGEN training
   ?**

   It is reasonable to train for 10 to 15 days on 2 to 4 GPUs in 256x256
   or 360x360. In 64x64 or 128x128, a couple days may suffice, always a
   good starting point.

   In general:

   -  With GANs, convergence can be visually assessed within 1 or 2
      days, then fine-grained details start to appear

   -  With diffusion for object insertion, training is smoother due to
      the straight supervision, and good results are obtained with a
      couple of days, then 300 to 400 epochs are reasonable
