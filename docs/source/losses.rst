************
 GAN losses
************

By design GAN optimize multiple networks in parallel, and thus exhibit
numerous losses. These losses are trained adversarially, i.e. against
each other. A consequence is most losses do not exhibit straight
increasing or decreasing behaviors. As a matter of fact, stabilized and
noisy losses are a good sign that training of all networks is balanced.

Review of GAN losses in JoliGEN:

-  **G_xxx**: Generator losses

   -  **G_tot_avg**: average total of all Generator losses. Adversarial.
   -  **G_GAN_D_B_xxx_avg**: Generator loss against Discriminator xxx on
      domain B, averaged. There's one per Discriminator. Adversarial.
   -  **G_NCE_avg**: contrastive loss on Generator between domains A and
      B (`cut` model only). Descending.
   -  **G_NCE_Y_avg**: contrastive loss on Generator on identify (B to
      B) (`cut` model only). Descending.
   -  **G_sem_mask_AB**: supervised loss on mask conservation across
      domains A and B. Descending.
   -  **G_out_mask_AB**: supervised conservation loss on pixels outside
      of masks, across domains A and B. Descending.

-  **D_xxx**: Discriminator losses

   -  **D_GAN_D_B_xxx_avg**: Discriminator xxx loss between real and
      fake data on domain B. There's one per Discriminator. Adversarial.

-  **f_s**: losses of the supervised class or mask
   classifiers/segmenters. Descending.

*************
 DDPM losses
*************

DDPMs are trained in a supervised manner. Therefore there's most often a
single descending loss to be monitored.

Review of DDPM losses in JoliGEN:

-  **G_tot_avg**: average of the denoising network loss. Descending.
