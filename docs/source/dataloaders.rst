 Dataloaders
#############

Every dataset type requires a dedicated dataloader, for the classes,
masks or bounding boxes to be processed accordingly.

There are two types of datasets and thus dataloaders:

- **Unaligned datasets**: images from domain A and B do not come as pairs
- **Aligned datasets**: images from domain A and B are paired

Next, there's a special type of dataloaders for online pre-processing
and augmentation:

- **Online**: dataloaders that automatically crop and zoom in / zoom out
  around various elements of images, most often according to masks and
  bounding boxes.

Online dataloaders are one of the great features of JoliGEN: they
allow to avoid a long pre-processing of the datasets, e.g. resizing
images, generating crops of interest, etc...

There's a special type of dataloaders for sequential data:

- **Temporal**: dataloaders that load sequences of images, used for
  temporal discriminators in GANs, and temporal conditioning in DDPMs.

Finally, there's a special type of self-supervised dataloader, used by
DDPMs only:

- **self-supervised**: dataloaders that modify the input data in order to
  generate self-supervised tasks, e.g. by removing portions of an
  image for training an inpainting DDPM.

To choose a dataloader please use the flag ``--dataset_mode dataloader_name``.

 Online Dataloaders and Options
********************************************

Online dataloaders are useful when:

- Images are too large to be processed fully
- Dataset is labeled and model training should concentrate on labeled areas
- Dataset is small and can benefit from augmentation from random cropping

The online dataloader applies the following steps:

- Loads the input image according to `--data_oinline_creation_load_size_{A,B}`
- Pick a bounding box randomly
- Builds a mask from the bounding box
- Crop around the bounding box according to fixed size
  `--data_online_creation_crop_size_{A,B}` 
- Randomly pick and apply a positive or negative offset to the crop
  size according to `--data_online_creation_crop_delta_{A,B}`. This
  allows random variations around the fixed size of the crop.
- Randomly pick and apply a positive or negative offset to the mask
  according to `--data_online_creation_mask_delta_{A,B}`. This step
  allows for an object in domain A to roughly match the size of an
  object in domain B. E.g. turning cars into buses requires an offset
  on masks from the car domain so that the mask can fit a bus.

********************************************
 Temporal Dataloaders and Options
********************************************

Temporal dataloaders read sequences of images. This is useful in two
cases:

- Temporal smoothing with GANs using a temporal discriminator
- Frame conditioning with DDPMs

The temporal dataloader applies the following steps:

- Uses the `--data_temporal_num_common_char` to sort the frames in the
  dataset. The number of common characters defines the length of the
  filename that should not be used for sorting. E.g. sorting files
  named `image_xxxx` would use 6 as the number of common chars,
  sorting based on xxxx only.
- Selects `--data_temporal_number_frames` interleaved with
  `--data_temporal_frame_step` frames. This is useful to control the
  temporal smoothing or conditioning independently from the video's
  true frames per second.
