 Overview of Code Structure
############################

To help users better understand and use our codebase, we briefly
overview the functionality and implementation of each package and each
module. Please see the documentation in each file for more details. If
you have questions, you may find useful information in
:ref:`training/test tips <tips>` and :ref:`frequently asked questions
<qa>`.

`train.py <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/train.py>`__
is a general-purpose training script. It works for various models (with
option ``--model``: e.g., ``cycle_gan``, ``cut``,
``cycle_gan_semantic``, â€¦) and different datasets (with option
``--dataset_mode``: e.g., ``aligned``, ``unaligned``,
``unaligned_labeled``, ``unaligned_labeled_mask``). See the section
:ref:`Datasets <datasets>` and :ref:`training/test tips <tips>` for more
details.

`test.py <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/test.py>`__
is a general-purpose test script. Once you have trained your model with
``train.py``, you can use this script to test the model. It will load a
saved model from ``--checkpoints_dir`` and save the results to
``--results_dir``. See :ref:`training/test tips <tips>` for more
details.

`data <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data>`__
directory contains all the modules related to data loading and
preprocessing. To add a custom dataset class called ``dummy``, you need
to add a file called ``dummy_dataset.py`` and define a subclass
``DummyDataset`` inherited from ``BaseDataset``. You need to implement
four functions: ``__init__`` (initialize the class, you need to first
call ``BaseDataset.__init__(self, opt)``), ``__len__`` (return the size
of dataset), ``__getitem__`` (get a data point), and optionally
``modify_commandline_options`` (add dataset-specific options and set
default options). Now you can use the dataset class by specifying flag
``--dataset_mode dummy``. See our template dataset `class
<https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/template_dataset.py>`__
for an example. Below we explain each file in details.

-  `__init__.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/__init__.py>`__
   implements the interface between this package and training and test
   scripts. ``train.py`` and ``test.py`` call ``from data import
   create_dataset`` and ``dataset = create_dataset(opt)`` to create a
   dataset given the option ``opt``.

-  `base_dataset.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/base_dataset.py>`__
   implements an abstract base class (`ABC
   <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>`__ ) for datasets. It
   also includes common transformation functions (e.g.,
   ``get_transform``, ``__scale_width``), which can be later used in
   subclasses.

-  `image_folder.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/image_folder.py>`__
   implements an image folder class. We modify the official PyTorch
   image folder `code
   <https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/datasets/folder.py>`__
   so that this class can load images from both the current directory
   and its subdirectories.

-  `template_dataset.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/template_dataset.py>`__
   provides a dataset template with detailed documentation. Check out
   this file if you plan to implement your own dataset.

-  `aligned_dataset.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/aligned_dataset.py>`__
   includes a dataset class that can load image pairs. It assumes a
   single image directory ``/path/to/data/train``, which contains image
   pairs in the form of {A,B}. See `here
   <https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/docs/tips.md#prepare-your-own-datasets-for-pix2pix>`__
   on how to prepare aligned datasets. During test time, you need to
   prepare a directory ``/path/to/data/test`` as test data.

-  `unaligned_dataset.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/unaligned_dataset.py>`__
   includes a dataset class that can load unaligned/unpaired datasets.
   It assumes that two directories to host training images from domain A
   ``/path/to/data/trainA`` and from domain B ``/path/to/data/trainB``
   respectively. Then you can train the model with the dataset flag
   ``--dataroot /path/to/data``. Similarly, you need to prepare two
   directories ``/path/to/data/testA`` and ``/path/to/data/testB``
   during test time.

-  `single_dataset.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/single_dataset.py>`__
   includes a dataset class that can load a set of single images
   specified by the path ``--dataroot /path/to/data``. It can be used
   for generating CycleGAN results only for one side with the model
   option ``-model test``.

-  `colorization_dataset.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/colorization_dataset.py>`__
   implements a dataset class that can load a set of nature images in
   RGB, and convert RGB format into (L, ab) pairs in `Lab
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space>`__ color space. It
   is required by pix2pix-based colorization model (``--model
   colorization``).

-  `unaligned_labeled_dataset.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/unaligned_labeled_dataset/py>`__
   implements a dataset class that can load an unaligned/unpaired
   dataset with labels (for domain A). It assumes that two directories
   to host training images from domain A ``/path/to/data/trainA`` and
   from domain B ``/path/to/data/trainB`` respectively. In trainA,
   images are distributed into directories, each corresponding to a
   class. Then you can train the model with the dataset flag
   ``--dataroot /path/to/data``. Similarly, you need to prepare two
   directories ``/path/to/data/testA`` and ``/path/to/data/testB``
   during test time.

-  `unaligned_labeled_mask_dataset.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/data/unaligned_labeled_mask_dataset/py>`__
   implements a dataset class that can load an unaligned/unpaired
   dataset with pixel labels (segmentation/attention masks). It assumes
   two directories to host training images from domain A
   ``/path/to/data/trainA`` and from domain B ``/path/to/data/trainB``
   respectively. In trainA and trainB, there is a ``paths.txt`` file
   which contains paths to every image and to its label. Then you can
   train the model with the dataset flag ``--dataroot /path/to/data``.
   Similarly, you need to prepare two directories
   ``/path/to/data/testA`` and ``/path/to/data/testB`` during test time.

`models <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/models>`__
directory contains modules related to objective functions,
optimizations, and network architectures. To add a custom model class
called ``dummy``, you need to add a file called ``dummy_model.py`` and
define a subclass ``DummyModel`` inherited from ``BaseModel``. You need
to implement four functions: ``__init__`` (initialize the class; you
need to first call ``BaseModel.__init__(self, opt)``), ``set_input``
(unpack data from dataset and apply preprocessing), ``forward``
(generate intermediate results), ``optimize_parameters`` (calculate
loss, gradients, and update network weights), and optionally
``modify_commandline_options`` (add model-specific options and set
default options). Now you can use the model class by specifying flag
``--model dummy``. See our template model `class
<https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/models/template_model.py>`__
for an example. Below we explain each file in details.

-  `__init__.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/models/__init__.py>`__

   scripts. ``train.py`` and ``test.py`` call ``from models import
   create_model`` and ``model = create_model(opt)`` to create a model
   given the option ``opt``. You also need to call ``model.setup(opt)``
   to properly initialize the model.

-  `base_model.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/models/base_model.py>`__
   implements an abstract base class (`ABC
   <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>`__ ) for models. It also
   includes commonly used helper functions (e.g., ``setup``, ``test``,
   ``update_learning_rate``, ``save_networks``, ``load_networks``),
   which can be later used in subclasses.

-  `template_model.py

   translation without paired data. The model training requires
   ``--dataset_mode unaligned`` dataset. By default, it uses a ``--netG
   resnet_9blocks`` ResNet generator, a ``--netD basic`` discriminator
   (PatchGAN introduced by pix2pix), and a least-square GANs `objective
   <https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04076>`__ (``--gan_mode lsgan``).

-  `networks.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/models/networks.py>`__

   unaligned_labeled_mask`` dataset. By default, it uses a ``--netG
   resnet_9blocks`` ResNet generator, a ``--netD basic`` discriminator
   (PatchGAN introduced by pix2pix), and a least-square GANs `objective
   <https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04076>`__ (``--gan_mode lsgan``).

`options <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/options>`__
directory includes our option modules: training options, test options,
and basic options (used in both training and test). ``TrainOptions`` and
``TestOptions`` are both subclasses of ``BaseOptions``. They will reuse
the options defined in ``BaseOptions``.

-  `__init__.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/options/__init__.py>`__
   is required to make Python treat the directory ``options`` as
   containing packages,

-  `base_options.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/options/base_options.py>`__
   includes options that are used in both training and test. It also
   implements a few helper functions such as parsing, printing, and
   saving the options. It also gathers additional options defined in
   ``modify_commandline_options`` functions in both dataset class and
   model class.

-  `train_options.py

   packages,

-  `get_data.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/util/get_data.py>`__
   provides a Python script for downloading CycleGAN and pix2pix
   datasets. Alternatively, You can also use bash scripts such as
   `download_pix2pix_model.sh
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh>`__
   and `download_cyclegan_model.sh
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/scripts/download_cyclegan_model.sh>`__.

-  `html.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/util/html.py>`__
   implements a module that saves images into a single HTML file. It
   consists of functions such as ``add_header`` (add a text header to
   the HTML file), ``add_images`` (add a row of images to the HTML
   file), ``save`` (save the HTML to the disk). It is based on Python
   library ``dominate``, a Python library for creating and manipulating
   HTML documents using a DOM API.

-  `image_pool.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/util/image_pool.py>`__
   implements an image buffer that stores previously generated images.
   This buffer enables us to update discriminators using a history of
   generated images rather than the ones produced by the latest
   generators. The original idea was discussed in this `paper
   <http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Shrivastava_Learning_From_Simulated_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf>`__.
   The size of the buffer is controlled by the flag ``--pool_size``.

-  `visualizer.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/util/visualizer.py>`__
   includes several functions that can display/save images and
   print/save logging information. It uses a Python library ``visdom``
   for display and a Python library ``dominate`` (wrapped in ``HTML``)
   for creating HTML files with images.

-  `util.py
   <https://github.com/jolibrain/joliGEN/blob/master/util/util.py>`__
   consists of simple helper functions such as ``tensor2im`` (convert a
   tensor array to a numpy image array), ``diagnose_network`` (calculate
   and print the mean of average absolute value of gradients), and
   ``mkdirs`` (create multiple directories).
